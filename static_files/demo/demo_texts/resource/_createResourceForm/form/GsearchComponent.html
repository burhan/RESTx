    <h3>A form to create a new RESTful web service</h3>
    <p>What you see here is the form you fill in to create a new RESTful web service.
    Some elements of the form are the same for each component, since that is where you
    specify general information about a RESTful resource. Other elements of the form
    are unique for every component, since each of them has its own, unique
    set of parameters it requires. Through the form you provide values for those parameters,
    which the RESTx server then stores for later use. We have more information on our web
    site about <a href="http://restx.mulesoft.org/about-restful-resources" target="_blank">RESTful resources</a>.</p>

    <h3>Elements that are the same for every component</h3>
    <p>First element in the form is the
    <span onmouseover="rowHighlight('Make_this_a_specialized_component');" onmouseout="stopRowHighlight('Make_this_a_specialized_component');" class="lref">specialized flag</span>.
    We will explain the meaning of this later in the demo. For now, please just leave this flag unset.</p>
    <p>Next there is the 
    <span onmouseover="rowHighlight('Resource_name');" onmouseout="stopRowHighlight('Resource_name');" class="lref">resource name</span> field. This is
    the name you want to give the new resource. It will appear in the URI of the resource once it is created and is a chance for you to give
    the resource a name that makes sense to the users of the resource once it is created. For our example here, let's call it "restx_search_results", because
    we are going to create a resource that creates Google search results for the term "RESTx". Please enter "restx_search_results" into the form field now (exactly as
    written here, since that exact name is expected for the demo). Note that the value you enter here is just a suggestion to the server. While it normally follows
    your suggestion, there might be cases where the server choses a different name instead. The actually chosen name will be communicated to you after the
    resource was created.</p>

    <p>Finally we have the
    <span onmouseover="rowHighlight('Description');" onmouseout="stopRowHighlight('Description');" class="lref">description</span> field. This allows you
    to enter a short, one-line description for your users, which summarizes quickly what this resource is. Here you could enter something like "A set of
    search results for the term 'RESTx'", for example.</p>

    <h3>Elements that are specific to a component</h3>
    <p>Besides the previous three elements, which are the same every time you create a resource, each component very often also
    has its own, unique set of parameters. For our Google-search component, we first have the
    <span onmouseover="rowHighlight('api_key');" onmouseout="stopRowHighlight('api_key');" class="lref">api_key</span>, which you can
    get from Google's web site. Turns out we are using a Google API where this key is actually not needed after all, so you can just
    enter here anything you like (it's still a mandatory form field, so a value is required).</p>
    <p>Next we have the
    <span onmouseover="rowHighlight('default_search');" onmouseout="stopRowHighlight('default_search');" class="lref">default search</span> value.
    Please enter "RESTx" here, since that is the term we want to search for.</p>
